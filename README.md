# Sampling Assignment - UCS654: Predictive Analytics

## 📚 Project Overview
This repository contains the solution for the **Sampling** assignment, which is part of the **UCS654: Predictive Analytics** course at **Thapar University**. The assignment demonstrates how to perform various sampling techniques on datasets to extract meaningful insights, and apply those methods in real-world data analysis scenarios.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to apply different **sampling techniques** to a given dataset and analyze the results. The techniques explored include:
- **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)**
- **Systematic Sampling**
- **Stratified Sampling**
- **Cluster Sampling**

The assignment focuses on understanding the strengths and limitations of each technique and how to use them effectively in predictive modeling and data analysis.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 🛠️ (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** 🧮 (for numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib** 📊 (for data visualization)

## 📝 How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Japneet-123/Sampling.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Run the main Python script (`sampling.py` or whichever file contains your implementation):

   ```bash
   python sampling.py
   ```

## 📊 Output
The program will:
- Perform different sampling methods on the provided dataset.
- Visualize and display the results of each sampling method.
- Provide insights into the distribution and characteristics of the sampled data.

## 🔍 Key Learnings
- Implementing various **sampling techniques** and understanding their practical applications.
- Learning how to assess the effectiveness and accuracy of different sampling methods.
- Gaining proficiency in handling data with **Pandas** and **NumPy** for analysis.
- Visualizing sampling distributions using **Matplotlib**.
